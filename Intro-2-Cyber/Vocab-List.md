ssh:
SSH (Secure Shell) is a network protocol used to securely access and manage remote systems over a potentially unsecured network. It provides encrypted communication and authentication methods, allowing users to log into remote servers and execute commands as if they were physically present.

whoami:
The whoami command is used to display the current username of the user who is currently logged into the system. It provides a quick way to identify the user context within a terminal session.

ls:
The ls command is used to list the contents of a directory. When executed without any arguments, it displays the names of files and subdirectories within the current working directory.

cat:
The cat command (short for "concatenate") is used to display the contents of one or more text files in the terminal. It reads and outputs the content of files sequentially, making it useful for viewing or combining text files.

history:
The history command displays a list of previously executed commands in the terminal session. It provides a record of commands entered by the user, along with their command numbers. This command is helpful for reviewing past actions and rerunning commands from history.
